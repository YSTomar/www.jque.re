<h2>About</h2>
<p>When The Handpicked jQuery Plugins Repository first launched in 2011, it was a basic site with a handful of cool plugins, and not looking great in terms of design.</p>
<p>The site constantly went down due to new demand for curated plugins, and the official <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery plugins registry</a> was famously down for the best part of a year. People needed their jQuery fix, and I was giving it to them.</p>
<p>The site gets increasingly lean and mean over time. Outdated plugins get removed, and new ones take their place. The colors change, the CDN gets better, and more new fans <a href="https://github.com/SoHiggo/www.jque.re/archive/gh-pages.zip" target="_blank">download the repo</a> each day to experiment with the plugins.</p>
<p>The awesome people at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.maxcdn.com/">MaxCDN </a>are sponsoring us, and this allows the site to load much faster. Others can hotlink to scripts, and browsing the site feels much faster. All the plugins are served from <a target="_blank" href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages,</a> so the site is easier to maintain.</p>
<p>I have done lots of behind-the-scenes plumbing to get these plugins loading as fast as possible. There is even a <a href="http://code.jque.re/" target="_blank">sister site that enables you to easily copy and paste any version of jQuery you want to use whilst coding.</a></p>
<p>Version 3 is the full expression of this repo as it stands now. I could not have hoped for a more gorgeous selection of plugins coded by some very talented people. Bear in mind, all this is <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/SoHiggo">open source, and on Github</a>.
<p>Thanks to everybody who has shared the URL on Twitter or linked to the Repo elsewhere. It's the fans that make this Repo get smarter, better, and stronger each year. If you write jQuery plugins and feel like your plugin deserves a place here, you can use the <a href="/feedback.html">feedback form</a>, or simply <a href="http://higg.tel/" rel="nofollow">contact me.</a>
</p>
<p>- <a href="http://www.higg.im/" target="_blank">David Higgins</a> (Curator, Designer, and coder of The Repo).</p>
<p>The Handpicked jQuery Plugins Repository is a carefully selected roundup of some of the best jQuery Plugins ever released. Here we offer you the ability to browse through the plugins, or download a plugin that you fancy. Whether you're building a huge Web-Application, or a simple site, we've got you covered. We also offer you the ability to hot-link directly to these plugin scripts through our CDN service, so your site loads much faster.</p>
<p>You might want to read the <a href="http://higg.so/2014/03/04/the-handpicked-jquery-plugins-repository/" target="_blank">blogpost</a> concerning this repo, and the reasoning behind it. Remember, if you feel a plugin is missing from this, you can build your own repo using this site's code as a template. The aim of this repo is quality over quantity.</p>
<p>Below is a list of CDN URLs you should use if you're going to implement a plugin on your site. We are on a dedicated MaxCDN setup so all JS is Gzipped and served from 16 "edge locations" from around the world for peace of mind.</p>
<p>Many thanks to <a href="http://www.maxcdn.com/" target="_blank">MaxCDN</a> for making this project possible.<br>
